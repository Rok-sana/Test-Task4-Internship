Soil erosion detection

Here is one of the open problems in Quantum. Soil erosion is a really unwanted process that spoils huge areas of fertile land. Your task is to train model for erosion detection.

What do you have 
Sentinel2 tile (T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2);
Masks with soil erosion for this tile (masks directory);

What should we get

As usual it should be github repository that contains:
jupyter notebook with data analysis;
script for model training (preferably tf.keras);
readme file;
requirements.txt file;
solution report. This is the most important part. We expect here not only solution description but also your proposals and result of research in different papers about soil erosion detection problem. In other words - what can help us to solve problem in the most effective way.
